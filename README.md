### **Scenario**
You are developing a simple full-stack application for managing tasks.
- **Backend:** Create an ASP.NET Core Web API with a `Tasks` controller.
  - The API should have endpoints to **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** tasks.
  - The `Task` entity should include `Id`, `Title`, `Description`, and `DueDate`.
- **Frontend:** Implement a React or Angular page that displays the task list and allows users to add new tasks.
- **Database:** Use Entity Framework Core with a SQL database to store tasks.
- **Azure Deployment:** Deploy both the frontend and backend to Azure and expose the API securely via **Azure Application Gateway**.
